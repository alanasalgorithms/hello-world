# hello-world
a place to store my ideas, organize resources, and discuss things with other people.

Hello! My name is Alana Burrell, you can call me Lay. I am a DDEP student at Spelman College and I am very lucky to be here. Spelman is my dream college and I'm always happy to remind myself I have met this life goal that I've set for myself. I hope to graduate and work in R&D engineering or possibly as a software engineer that works on software for cars and other things IOT related.
